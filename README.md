# covid-pandemic-visualization

In this project we analyze and visualize data on the course 
of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK from April 2020 to April 2022.

The project includes comparisons of the number of cases, 
PCR tests performed, and deaths for 4 UK countries: 
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

In addition, the project includes analyses of the impact
of the pandemic on the level of anxiety and unemployment, 
as well as a comparison of the course of the pandemic with Poland.
